This report presents the analysis completed for Exercise 1 of the Data Mining course.
The objective was to inspect, clean, and visualise a dataset containing global primary 
school enrolment statistics. The raw dataset contained various irregularities, including 
non-numerical units and missing gender-specific breakdowns for males. Through a sequence 
of data preparation steps—including feature engineering to derive missing values—the 
dataset was transformed into a consistent form. The following pages document the cleaning 
methodology and showcase the resulting global trends, gender comparisons, and distributions.

\section{Introduction}

The dataset provided for Exercise 1 contains annual primary education enrolment figures
for multiple countries. Before meaningful analysis could be performed, several data quality
challenges had to be addressed. These included mixed units of measurement (absolute numbers 
vs. percentages), unused attributes, and the absence of a specific "Male" category (data 
was provided only as "All genders" and "Female").

The aim of this exercise was therefore:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To perform structured data cleaning and type conversion.
    \item To engineer new features (specifically calculating Male enrolments).
    \item To produce visual representations regarding global trends, distributions, and top-ranking countries.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Cleaning and Processing Overview}

The preparation of the dataset followed a series of clearly defined steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial inspection \& Renaming:} Verbose labels such as \textit{Reference Area} were renamed to \textit{Country} for clarity.
    \item \textbf{Filtering by unit:} Rows where \textit{Units of measurement} was not "Number" were removed to ensure analytical consistency.
    \item \textbf{Type consistency:} Year and Enrolment columns were converted to integer and float types respectively.
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering (Deriving Male Data):} A critical observation was that "Male" data was missing. We pivoted the dataset and calculated the missing column using the formula: $ \text{Male} = \text{All Genders} - \text{Female} $.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Exercise 1 demonstrated the importance of careful data cleaning. The presence of mixed reporting units and missing attributes (such as the Male category) required specific preprocessing steps. By deriving the male population data and standardising the units, we were able to visualize that while global enrolment trends are similar across genders, a persistent gap remains between male and female education participation.
