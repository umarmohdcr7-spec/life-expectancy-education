\begin{abstract}
This report documents the solution for the Data Mining Sheet 4 exercises. 
The objective was to gather, inspect, clean, and visualise real-world datasets regarding 
Global Education. The analysis covers three distinct levels of education:
\textbf{Primary (Ex 1)}, \textbf{Secondary (Ex 2)}, and \textbf{Tertiary (Ex 3)}.
Across all datasets, consistent data cleaning strategies were applied to handle non-numerical 
units and missing gender attributes. The results highlight distinct trends, particularly 
the shifting gender balance as education levels increase.

\section{Exercise 1: Primary Education Analysis}

\subsection{Introduction \& Data Cleaning}
The first dataset contained annual primary education enrolment figures. Key data quality 
challenges included mixed units (percentages vs numbers) and missing male data.
The cleaning process involved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Renaming:} Simplifying \textit{Reference Area} to \textit{Country}.
    \item \textbf{Filtering:} Removing rows where \textit{Units of measurement} was not "Number".
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering:} Calculating Male enrolments using: $ \text{Male} = \text{All Genders} - \text{Female} $.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercise 2: Secondary Education Analysis}

\subsection{Overview}
Following the methodology established in Exercise 1, we analyzed the \texttt{secondary.csv} dataset. 
The cleaning steps were identical, focusing on unit standardization and deriving the male population count.

% EXERCISE 3: TERTIARY EDUCATION
% ==========================================
\section{Exercise 3: Tertiary Education Analysis}

\subsection{Overview}
The final analysis focused on \texttt{tertiary.csv}, representing higher education enrolments. 
While the data structure mirrored the previous datasets, the trends revealed in this specific education 
level differed significantly from Primary and Secondary education.

\subsection{Strategy and Processing}
The cleaning strategy remained consistent to ensure comparability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cleaning:} Rows with non-numerical units were removed. Redundant columns (\textit{Age group}) were dropped.
    \item \textbf{Transformation:} The "Male" attribute was derived via the formula $ \text{Male} = \text{Total} - \text{Female} $.
    \item \textbf{Observation:} Unlike the previous datasets, this file appears to contain aggregated regional data (e.g., "Developing Regions") alongside individual country data, as seen in the Top 20 plot.
\end{itemize}

% ==========================================
\section{Exercise 4: Public Education Expenditure as \% of GDP}

\subsection{Overview}
This dataset contains annual public expenditure on education expressed as a
percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Unlike the previous datasets focused 
on student enrolments, this indicator reflects how much of a country's economic 
output is invested into its education system. Each row corresponds to a single 
country-year observation.

\subsection{Data Cleaning}
The raw dataset obtained from \texttt{data.un.org} required several preprocessing
steps to ensure consistency:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Filtering units:} Only entries where the unit was ``Percent'' were retained.
    \item \textbf{Removing unusable entries:} Missing values (``..'') and non-numeric entries 
    were dropped.
    \item \textbf{Non-country entries:} Regional aggregates such as ``Arab States'' and 
    ``Landlocked Developing Countries'' were removed.
    \item \textbf{Type conversion:} The \textit{observation\_value} column was converted 
    to numeric floating-point values.
    \item \textbf{Column consistency:} Column names were cleaned and standardized 
    (e.g., \textit{Reference Area} → \textit{reference\_area}).
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Ex 4: Top 20 countries by maximum education expenditure as \% of GDP.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Observations}
Several patterns emerge from the visual analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Most countries allocate between \textbf{3\% and 7\%} of their GDP to education.
    \item Smaller or developing economies tend to show the highest relative expenditure.
    \item Global spending shows moderate variation across years, with no dramatic shifts.
    \item Large fluctuations in particular countries suggest political or economic instability.
\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusion}
The comprehensive analysis of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary education reveals a clear narrative.
While Primary and Secondary education show a historical male dominance in enrolment numbers, 
\textbf{Tertiary education shows a reversal of this trend}, with female participation exceeding 
male participation in the most recent years of the dataset. 

Common data quality issues—specifically the lack of explicit male data and inconsistent 
units—were successfully mitigated through a unified Python preprocessing pipeline, allowing 
for accurate comparative analysis across all three education levels.

\title{Analysis of Public Expenditure on Education}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}


This dataset reports annual public expenditure on education as a percentage of total government expenditure. 
Like the last dataset, this indicator shows how much of a government’s budget is allocated to education each year. 
Each row is a country–year pair with one numeric value—observation_value—measured in percent, indicating the share of total public spending devoted to education. 
Supporting fields include reference_area (country), time_period (year), and metadata columns (sex, age_group) marked “Not applicable.”

\section{Methodology}

The original raw dataset was cleaned in several steps. 
Column names were standardised, 
missing values were removed 
and duplicate rows were dropped.


The variable of interest was:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Observation\_Value}: Public Expenditure on Education (\% of Total Government Expenditure)
\end{itemize}

To explore a possible correlation between government expenditure and education,
the education expenditure data were merged with a separate cleaned dataset containing life expectancy
values for the same countries and years. Two main visualisations were created:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A line chart showing how education spending changed over time for a
          selection of countries.
    \item A scatter plot comparing education spending with life expectancy.
\end{itemize}

Simple descriptive statistics, such as mean expenditure per country, were also
computed.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Education Expenditure Over Time}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{education_over_time.png}
\caption{Public Expenditure on Education (\% of Total Government Expenditure)
for Germany, India, the United States of America, and Brazil.}
\end{figure}

The time-series plot shows that education expenditure differs considerably across
countries. Germany and the United States show relatively stable spending over
time, while India and Brazil display more noticeable fluctuations. India has the
highest peak in education expenditure in the early 2000s, while Germany remains
closer to 10\% throughout the period.

\subsection{Education Spending vs Life Expectancy}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{education_vs_lifeexp.png}
\caption{Scatter plot of education spending (\% of GDP) vs.\ life expectancy for
a random sample of countries.}
\end{figure}

The scatter plot suggests a mild upward trend, meaning that countries spending a
higher share of their resources on education tend to have slightly higher life
expectancy. However, the points are spread out and not closely aligned, so the
relationship is not very strong. Some countries with similar education
expenditure levels show quite different life expectancy values.

\subsection{Average Education Expenditure by Country}

A simple mean comparison shows which countries spend the most on education as a
share of government expenditure. The highest values in the dataset include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Vanuatu (29.3\%)
    \item Lesotho (26.2\%)
    \item Tunisia (25.5\%)
    \item Yemen (24.4\%)
    \item Kenya (24.4\%)
\end{itemize}

These countries consistently allocate a relatively large share of their budgets
to education compared to others in the dataset.

\section{Observations}

Overall, the results show that education expenditure varies widely between
countries and across years. Some countries invest a stable proportion of their
government budget in education, while others show stronger fluctuations.

The scatter plot indicates a weak positive association between education
spending and life expectancy. Although this suggests that higher investment in
education may be linked to better social outcomes, the relationship is far from
clear, and many other factors likely influence life expectancy.

\section{Conclusion}

From this we can conclude that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Education expenditure levels differ notably between countries.
    \item Some countries, such as India and Brazil, show strong year-to-year
          variation in spending.
    \item There is a slight positive relationship between education expenditure
          and life expectancy, based on visual inspection.
\end{itemize}

To obtain more precise conclusions, additional variables such as GDP, health
spending, or demographic factors would be needed.
analysis provides a basic overview of education spending patterns worldwide.
