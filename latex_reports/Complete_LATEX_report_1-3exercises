\begin{abstract}
This report documents the solution for the Data Mining Sheet 4 exercises. 
The objective was to gather, inspect, clean, and visualise real-world datasets regarding 
Global Education. The analysis covers three distinct levels of education:
\textbf{Primary (Ex 1)}, \textbf{Secondary (Ex 2)}, and \textbf{Tertiary (Ex 3)}.
Across all datasets, consistent data cleaning strategies were applied to handle non-numerical 
units and missing gender attributes. The results highlight distinct trends, particularly 
the shifting gender balance as education levels increase.

\section{Exercise 1: Primary Education Analysis}

\subsection{Introduction \& Data Cleaning}
The first dataset contained annual primary education enrolment figures. Key data quality 
challenges included mixed units (percentages vs numbers) and missing male data.
The cleaning process involved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Renaming:} Simplifying \textit{Reference Area} to \textit{Country}.
    \item \textbf{Filtering:} Removing rows where \textit{Units of measurement} was not "Number".
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering:} Calculating Male enrolments using: $ \text{Male} = \text{All Genders} - \text{Female} $.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercise 2: Secondary Education Analysis}

\subsection{Overview}
Following the methodology established in Exercise 1, we analyzed the \texttt{secondary.csv} dataset. 
The cleaning steps were identical, focusing on unit standardization and deriving the male population count.

% EXERCISE 3: TERTIARY EDUCATION
% ==========================================
\section{Exercise 3: Tertiary Education Analysis}

\subsection{Overview}
The final analysis focused on \texttt{tertiary.csv}, representing higher education enrolments. 
While the data structure mirrored the previous datasets, the trends revealed in this specific education 
level differed significantly from Primary and Secondary education.

\subsection{Strategy and Processing}
The cleaning strategy remained consistent to ensure comparability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cleaning:} Rows with non-numerical units were removed. Redundant columns (\textit{Age group}) were dropped.
    \item \textbf{Transformation:} The "Male" attribute was derived via the formula $ \text{Male} = \text{Total} - \text{Female} $.
    \item \textbf{Observation:} Unlike the previous datasets, this file appears to contain aggregated regional data (e.g., "Developing Regions") alongside individual country data, as seen in the Top 20 plot.
\end{itemize}

% EXERCISE 4: PUBLIC EDUCATION EXPENDITURE (% OF GDP)
% ==========================================
\section{Exercise 4: Public Education Expenditure as \% of GDP}

\subsection{Overview}
This dataset contains annual public expenditure on education expressed as a
percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Unlike the previous datasets focused 
on student enrolments, this indicator reflects how much of a country's economic 
output is invested into its education system. Each row corresponds to a single 
country-year observation.

\subsection{Data Cleaning}
The raw dataset obtained from \texttt{data.un.org} required several preprocessing
steps to ensure consistency:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Filtering units:} Only entries where the unit was ``Percent'' were retained.
    \item \textbf{Removing unusable entries:} Missing values (``..'') and non-numeric entries 
    were dropped.
    \item \textbf{Non-country entries:} Regional aggregates such as ``Arab States'' and 
    ``Landlocked Developing Countries'' were removed.
    \item \textbf{Type conversion:} The \textit{observation\_value} column was converted 
    to numeric floating-point values.
    \item \textbf{Column consistency:} Column names were cleaned and standardized 
    (e.g., \textit{Reference Area} → \textit{reference\_area}).
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Ex 4: Top 20 countries by maximum education expenditure as \% of GDP.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Observations}
Several patterns emerge from the visual analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Most countries allocate between \textbf{3\% and 7\%} of their GDP to education.
    \item Smaller or developing economies tend to show the highest relative expenditure.
    \item Global spending shows moderate variation across years, with no dramatic shifts.
    \item Large fluctuations in particular countries suggest political or economic instability.
\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusion}
The comprehensive analysis of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary education reveals a clear narrative.
While Primary and Secondary education show a historical male dominance in enrolment numbers, 
\textbf{Tertiary education shows a reversal of this trend}, with female participation exceeding 
male participation in the most recent years of the dataset. 

Common data quality issues—specifically the lack of explicit male data and inconsistent 
units—were successfully mitigated through a unified Python preprocessing pipeline, allowing 
for accurate comparative analysis across all three education levels.
